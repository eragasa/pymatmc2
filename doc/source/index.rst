python materials multicell monte carlo ("pymat(mc)^2") implements an algorithm
which multiple simulation cells are evolved where the the ground state phases can be 
determined.

The current state of the project focuses upon DFT simulations, but will also include 
the ability to use molecular dynamics to sample from the NVT and NPT ensembles.

This documentation will evolve as the porting of the original codes by: Rao and 
SomeOtherDude into a new codebase, which leverages the Materials Ex Machina (mexm-base)
software framework for the automation of compuational materials science tasks.
